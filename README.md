# Together it's more fun

Most people have enough food and water[[1]](https://www.gapminder.org/). 

Nevertheless many people miss something. 

A feeling of belonging, a feeling of friendship.

There are several commercial plattforms trying to solve this:

Instagram, Facebook, .....

They all focus on the surface. Good looking people, bright smiles, beautiful faces with
tons of make-up.

That's not what I am looking for.

Goals:

* The plattform should be simple. 
* The plattform should be without pictures.
* The plattform should be open source, so everyone can run his own version.
* The plattform should encourage online and face-to-face meetings.
* The plattform should encourage learning together.
* The plattform should encourage helping each other.

How does it work:

* You register and specify the things you like to learn, where you can help or where you need help.
* If you are lucky you find someone in your neighbourhood which fits to your profile.

It is not about dating. It is about building small working groups for learing and helping.
